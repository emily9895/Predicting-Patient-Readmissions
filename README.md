Predicting Patient Readmissions with Machine Learning (using R)
Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Readmitted) are converted to factors for modeling.
Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
Logistic Regression Model: A logistic regression model is trained using the caret package with 10-fold cross-validation.
Predictions: Probabilities of readmission are predicted for the test dataset. A threshold of 0.5 is used to classify patients as readmitted or not.
Model Evaluation:A confusion matrix is used to evaluate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.An ROC curve is plotted to assess the model's performance, with the AUC value calculated.
Feature Importance:The relative importance of each predictor is calculated and visualized.

Interpretation of AUC = 0.75
Performance: It has good discriminative ability to distinguish between positive (e.g., "readmitted") and negative (e.g., "not readmitted") classes.
Practical Implications: The model predictions are reliable and might add much value for decision-making.
